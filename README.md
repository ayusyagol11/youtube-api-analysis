## ‚úèÔ∏è Aim and Objectives
### Aim
To conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of video performance data from the Ayusy YouTube channel and provide data-driven recommendations to optimize content strategy and engagement.

### Objectives
1. **Utilize YouTube API**: Extract and analyze video data to understand YouTube analytics.
2. **Analyze Video Performance**: Investigate factors influencing video performance, including:
   - Impact of engagement (likes, comments) on views.
   - Effect of video duration on engagement.
   - Influence of title length and tags on video performance.
3. **Audience Interaction**: Analyze viewer comments to identify common themes and improve future content.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Data Collection
Data was collected using the **YouTube Data API v3**. The following steps were performed:
1. **Channel Statistics**: Extracted channel-level metrics (subscribers, views, total videos).
2. **Video Details**: Retrieved metadata for all videos (title, description, tags, views, likes, comments, duration).
3. **Comments**: Collected top-level comments for each video (limited to 10 comments per video due to API constraints).

### ‚úèÔ∏è Libraries Used
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**: Data visualization.
- **Google API Client**: Access YouTube API.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Processing for comment analysis.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Checked for null values and converted count columns to numeric types.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Converted `publishedAt` to datetime format and extracted the day of the week.
   - Transformed video duration from ISO format to seconds.
   - Calculated metrics like tags count, likes/comments per 1000 views, and title length.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Key Insights
1. **Engagement Distribution**:
   - Most videos have low engagement, with a few outliers achieving high views and likes.
   - Right-skewed distributions for views, likes, and comments indicate that only a small subset of videos performs exceptionally well.

2. **Publish Day Analysis**:
   - **Optimal Days**: Saturday and Sunday yield the highest average views, likes, and comments.
   - **Less Effective Days**: Monday to Wednesday show lower engagement.

3. **Video Duration**:
   - Videos shorter than 8 minutes (500 seconds) tend to perform better.
   - Longer videos (>500 seconds) see a drop in engagement.

4. **Engagement Ratios**:
   - Videos with higher likes and comments per 1000 views are considered high-engagement.
   - Identifying patterns in these videos can help replicate success.

5. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Strong positive correlation between views and likes (0.94).
   - Moderate correlation between views and comments (0.65).
   - Weak negative correlation between video duration and engagement.

6. **Tags and Titles**:
   - No clear relationship between the number of tags and views.
   - Title length does not significantly impact views, but concise and descriptive titles are recommended.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Conclusion
- **Optimal Publishing**: Post videos on weekends (Saturday and Sunday) for higher engagement.
- **Video Length**: Keep videos under 8 minutes to retain viewer interest.
- **Engagement Strategies**: Focus on creating content that encourages likes and comments to boost engagement ratios.
- **Tags and Titles**: Use relevant tags and concise, descriptive titles to improve discoverability.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Future Work
1. **Content Experimentation**: Test different video formats and lengths to identify what resonates with the audience.
2. **Audience Analysis**: Dive deeper into viewer demographics and preferences.
3. **Advanced NLP**: Perform sentiment analysis on comments to gauge audience sentiment.
4. **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different titles, thumbnails, and tags to optimize performance.
