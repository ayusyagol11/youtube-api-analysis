## Project: Analyzing My YouTube Channel Performance (Ayusy)
In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of my YouTube channel’s performance using data from the YouTube API. The goal was to uncover patterns and actionable insights that could enhance reach and engagement. I analyzed various factors, including video duration, title length, engagement metrics (likes, comments), and tags, to identify what drives success on the platform. Based on these findings, I’ve developed data-driven recommendations to optimize content strategy and improve channel performance.

### Key insights:
- Saturdays are the best days for posting.
- Shorter videos (<8 minutes) yield higher engagement.
- Tags and title length have minimal impact on views.

Looking forward to optimizing my content strategy with these insights!
